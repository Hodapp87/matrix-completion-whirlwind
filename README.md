# Matrix Completion Whirlwind

By: Aaron Berk

## About

This is a whirlwind introduction to matrix completion theory and
methods. It was originally created for the [2017 BC Data Science
Workshop](http://workshop.bcdata.ca). Some modifications have been
made to protect proprietary data and heretofore unpublished methods.

This tutorial includes several exercises. Some of these exercises are
novel &mdash; you coudl be the first to answer them!

## Requirements

The notebook in this tutorial requires the `cvxpy` package, and relies
on the splitting cone solver `SCS`, which is [part of
`cvxgrp`](https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs). For installation details,
visit the [cvxpy
website](http://www.cvxpy.org/en/latest/install/index.html), which should cover the automatic installation of `SCS` and other solvers.

This code also requires the latest versions of `sklearn` and `scipy`.

## References

I have attempted to ensure that all appropriate references are given
in-line in the notebook. If it seems I have made an omission, please
e-mail me or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank [Oscar
Lopez](https://www.slim.eos.ubc.ca/content/oscar-lopez) for his help
and comments with some of the finer points of this tutorial.
